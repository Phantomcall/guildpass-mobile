git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/guildpass-mobile.git
cd guildpass-mobile

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a PR against `Adamantine-Guild/guildpass-mobile` on `main`.
3. Fill in the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) completely.
4. Ensure these pass before submitting:

```bash
pnpm typecheck   # Must pass with no errors
pnpm lint        # Fix all reported issues
pnpm test:run    # All tests must pass
```

### PR Quality Expectations

- UI changes must include a screenshot or screen recording in the PR description.
- Use NativeWind (Tailwind) classes — no `StyleSheet.create` for new UI unless justified.
- New screens must handle loading, empty, and error states.
- New business logic must have at least one Vitest unit test.
- Do not introduce native modules that break Expo Go compatibility without prior discussion.

---

## Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR within **5 business days**.
- Mobile PRs with UI changes may require a screen recording.
- Address requested changes promptly.
