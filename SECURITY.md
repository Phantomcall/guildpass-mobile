## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

### How to report

1. **Email** **maintainers@guildpass.xyz** with subject `[SECURITY] guildpass-mobile — <brief description>`.
2. Include a description, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours** and provide an assessment within **7 days**.

### Scope

This repository is a React Native / Expo mobile application.

**In-scope concerns:**
- Exposure of wallet private keys or mnemonics in logs, AsyncStorage, or app state
- Authentication or access-gate bypass via deep links or URL schemes
- Insecure storage of sensitive user data on device
- Man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities in API calls to guildpass-core
- XSS-equivalent attacks via WebView components (if used)

**Out-of-scope:**
- Vulnerabilities in guildpass-core backend — report to that repo
- Expo SDK / React Native platform vulnerabilities — report to their maintainers
- Physical device security (e.g., screen lock bypass)

### Disclosure Policy

- We ask for a **90-day** coordinated disclosure window.
- We will credit reporters in release notes unless you prefer anonymity.

Thank you for helping keep GuildPass secure.
